<p>Casa Almendras is a spacious private south facing villa set in a quiet cul de sac. It has a sea view and its own garden and attractive sun terraces. There is a large 11m x 4m private swimming pool with Roman steps, as well as a barbecue and covered Pergola for al fresco eating. Our beautiful Phoenix Palm, olive and almond trees provide welcome shade amongst the lemon and orange trees.</p>
<p>The villa is on two levels. The upper section of the house has a large main living room with a dining area and fully fitted kitchen, all with marble floors. This leads onto a covered terrace with the views of the sea where you can eat or just have a relaxing drink. On this upper floor there are 2 double bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, together with 2 fully tiled bathrooms, both with lavatories and wash basins.</p>
<p>The separate lower section of the villa has 1 double bedroom with fitted wardrobes and direct access to the pool, a shower/WC room and a large playroom with two bunk beds and furniture. It has in addition a living area with comfortable furniture and a utility space, with a second new fridge, where you can prepare barbecue food or breakfast. A new washing machine is also provided.</p>
<p>Facilities include a car port and parking (for two cars), sun beds, fans, a wood burning stove and gas central heating-if needed! The barbecue area has several outdoor tables with chairs. Satellite TV, wi fi, video and CD/radio/Casette player. </p>
<p>The house is in the exclusive Club Moraira area. It is about a 5 minute drive into the village or to the nearest beaches and shops, but there is a bar and good restaurant within 10 minutes walking distance. There is plenty of parking space in the village and along the coast except on market day!</p>
